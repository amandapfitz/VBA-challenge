# VBA-challenge

Stock market data in csv format was analyzed. The code I created runs across every worksheet just by running the code once.

Created a VBA script that loops through all the stocks for one year for each run and generates a summarizing table with the following information:
The ticker symbol.
Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
The total stock volume of the stock.
Greatest % Increase.
Greatest % Decrease.
Greatest Total Volume.
